two crystal cosmic heroes, bigger than planets, fight an endless battle in the vastness of cosmos, eons ago forgotting their cause and identity, eternal, and slowly corrupting. there is no bad or good side here, they are pretty much the same.
extremelly small shards of their armor pierce the sky, they may hit something, creating chaos, danger, euphoria and berserk, and defeat.
it happened to hit some barn on some earth like planet. 
hero, the ONE WHO CARES(foreshadowing- they will turn into one who cared XD), forced by the community of the nearby village arrive at the busstop, near the barn. there are some small sheds in the distance, trees, wheat fields.
and a cementery. of course. 
twisted corruption of the armor shard mutated all the workers of the barn turning them into beyond twisted occultists


the angel appears and warns you.

you approach the cementery.
at the cementery somebody made a artistic piece of a freshly sacrificed human being. and he did put a bench for someone
to sit and look at it.


you approach the garden.
the bodies are in the trees.
somebody made a tree from bodies.

you approach the sheds.
there is an occultist in evry one of them.
lets say its four

in one of the sheds there is a key.
you take it and you go to the barn.
